# Description

In first year of university, we had a module where we were taught the fundamentals of object orientated programming. We were tasked with creating objects for a program that prints out a golf scorecard with a certain layout in the console. The layout is shown below.

# Installation

Go onto Github, find the project and clone the repository.
Afterwards, open bash, locate the destinated file with 'cd', and use git clone on the cloned repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aanassor1/Java-Object-Orientated-Programming-Fundamentals.git
```

After, create a java product on an IDE that has a package. Put all the downloaded classes under the package and rename the first lines, and then put the input text files into the main project folder. Take the two input files' file paths, and use that as the input arguements to run the program.
